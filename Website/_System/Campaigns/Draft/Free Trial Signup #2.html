									<h1 style="font-size: 24px; color: black; margin: 0 0 21px;">Hi {tag_recipientfirstname}!</h1>
									Welcome to issue #2 of <em>5 ways to be successful online</em>. If you have any questions, <a href="{tag_siteurl}/support#2">please let us know</a> - I'm sure we can be of assistance. Now let's get into how building a customer database can help your business become successful online.<br>
<br>

									<h1 style="margin: 0 0 21px;">Build a Customer Database</h1>
									<img src="newsletter-img/db.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 18px;">
									Garnering awareness and acquiring customers is one of the great challenges or building a business. It's fair to say that any customer that finds your business or website is highly valuable to you, and you want to hold on to them as long as possible.<br>
<br>

									That's where the idea of a database comes in. A customer database is simply your electronic rolodex of customers that you have dealt with in the past. So why keep a list of them? Because they are your best source for future revenue and word of mouth. Who better to announce your newest product line to than the people who loved your last product line? Who better to spread the word about your new service than those who've used it previously?<br><br>

									That's all well and good, but how can you get your customers' contact information? Here's 4 simple strategies.<br><br>

									<ol>
										<li><strong>Give something away</strong> - Give every customer who fills in an online form something valuable in exchange for their email address. It could be a discount voucher, or an eBook that you have written, or access to 'premium' content inside your website.</li>
									  <li><strong>A simple "Contact Us" online form</strong> - so that your customers can ask questions and submit their comments. You'll be surprised by how many of your visitors will take the time to ask a question, and in the form, you can ask for their email address.</li>
									  <li><strong>Run an online discussion forum -</strong> People love to chat with other customers and share their knowledge and opinions. You can empower your customers to do the same, and as part of the process, they'll need to register their details with you to participate.</li>
									  <li><strong>Sell something - </strong> When people buy from your online shop, you can ask them for an email address to send the receipt/confirmation to.</li>
								  </ol>

							    In your online business free trial, you can do many of the above with just a few clicks. Most importantly, the contact details are all captured in one, central customer database so they're not strewn across multiple disconnected tools - you want them centralized so it's easy to make lists of customers to target with different promotions. Here's a 3 ways you can expand your customer database:<br>
<br>

									<img src="newsletter-img/pref.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 18px; margin-bottom: 36px;">
									<strong>Web Forms</strong> are automatically set up to capture customer details directly into your customer database. You can customize your own under <strong>Modules-> Web Forms</strong>, e.g the 'Contact Us' form.<br>
							    <br>

									<img src="newsletter-img/user.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 18px; margin-bottom: 36px;">
									<strong>Forums</strong> are found under Website->Forums. You can add one to your website - all the fiddly technical details, like capturing a username and password, are handled automatically as part of your forum.<br>
							    <br>

									<img src="newsletter-img/shop.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 18px; margin-bottom: 36px;">
									<strong>An Online Shop</strong> is integrated with your Online Business as standard functionality. All orders processed through your online shop are automatically linked to a customer record with your customer's contact details in it!<br>
